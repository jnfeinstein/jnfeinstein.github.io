I have been working since 2009 as a full stack software engineer.

I am currently employed at [Nyansa](http://www.nyansa.com/), a networking analytics startup in Silicon Valley.

I previously worked at [Cisco Meraki](http://www.meraki.com/) on the [MX](http://www.meraki.com/mx) product.  I was responsible for implementing the web experience, both frontend and backend components.  I primarily used Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, BackboneJS, and jQuery (of course HTML and CSS too).  I also dabbled in firmware development on Linux-based devices in C++.

Prior to that gig I worked at [Qualcomm QGov](http://www.qualcomm.com/qgov), a division dedicated to giving back to the community using Qualcomm's technologies.  I worked on various parts of Android OS, and developed Android applications using C++ and Java.  I also had the pleasure of studying 3GPP cellular standards.

Coding is my pesonal hobby as well as my profession, and I have many personal projects.  I have experimented with many technologies, including AngularJS, ReactJS, nodeJS, Go, Scala, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and many more!

My favorites personal projects include:

* [sonar](http://github.com/jnfeinstein/sonar), a hands-free solution to finding other humans
* [node-sdn](http://github.com/jnfeinstien/node-sdn), an experiment in building networking appliance using nodeJS and JavaScript
* [Rebalancer](http://github.com/jnfeinstein/gorebalancer), a tool to help you optimally rebalance your stock portfolio

I studied at [Carnegie Mellon Universty](http://www.cmu.edu/) between 2007 and 2011.  I hold an MS and BS in computer engineering, with an additional major in public policy.  I specialized in embedded systems and networking, and participated in research involving emulated wireless systems, and CPU overclocking.
